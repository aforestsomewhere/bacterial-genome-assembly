## Introduction

Bacterial genomes are extremely dynamic, undergoing frequent loss and gain of both chromosomal and extrachromosomal elements [1] including:

* insertion sequences
* rep sequences
* ICE elements
* plasmids
* prophage

This can be particularly interesting to food microbiologists in the context of adaptations to dynamic niches during food fermentations. In order to detect and characterise this kind of genomic plasticity, we require high quality bacterial genome assemblies which are both:

* Complete - fully contiguous
* Accurate - fully match the actual DNA sequence of the organism

Short-read sequencing (e.g. Illumina) provides high-quality reads which provide for accurate assemblies. The short length of reads (100-300bp) impedes assembly however, particularly at repetitive regions. This results in fragmented draft assemblies split up into several contigs. Furthermore, dynamic genome elements (such as ICE elements, IS) are often themselves repetitive, meaning that their true biological presence is not reflected in the draft assembly.

## Insertion sequences?

Insertion sequences are short genomic elements which are frequently found in bacterial genomes. They can shape genomes by moving around, with the potential to generate deletions and influence gene expression levels.

## REP sequences?

REP sequences are genomic regions containing highly repetitive and palindromic sequences. They are often located in the the extragenic space of some bacterial genomes e.g. ERIC sequences in Enterobacterales members (Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus).

## ICEs

Integrative and Conjugative elements are mobile genetic elements which can move between hosts and donors through conjugation. They are flanked on either side by direct repeat sequences, which allow them to excise through site-specific recombination.

## Figures

You can also include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

Or you can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
