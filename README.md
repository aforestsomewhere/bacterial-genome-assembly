# Introduction to Bacterial Genome Assembly with Trycycler

This lesson was developed for the Trycycler workshop/hackathon organised by DOMINO consortium (22nd April 2024).

## Credits 

The materials draws heavily on the work of Ryan Wick and others in the field in tool development and benchmarking, particularly:
